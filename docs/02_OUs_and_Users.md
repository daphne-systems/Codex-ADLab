This project documents my process of setting up a simple Active Directory environment, creating Organizational Units (OUs), and adding fictional users. Screenshots are included to show each step.

## 1. Creating Organizational Units

I created OUs to represent different departments in a fictional company:

- Executive 
- IT  
- Operations
- Publishing
- Research 
- Sales  

This makes it easier to organize users and apply group policies later.

## 2. Adding Users

For each OU, I created fictional users with unique usernames. Example:

- **IT Department**
  - John Smith (`Jsmith`)
  - Kevin Brown (`Kbrown`)

- **Research Department**
  - Ravi Patel (`RaviP`)
  - Omar Hassan (`OmarH`)

## 3. Final Structure

Hereâ€™s what the domain looks like once everything is in place:

## 4. Next Steps

From here, I will be expanding the lab by:  
- Creating **security groups** for each department.  
- Applying **Group Policies (GPOs)** to specific OUs.  
- Testing logins with the new accounts.
